h1. qdupe

A command-line utility to quickly find duplicate files, written in Python and inspired by "FastDup":http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastdup/

h2. Usage

<pre>
  $ bin/qdupe path [path..]
</pre>

h2. Algorithm

When you run qdupe, it will first scan all the files in the path(s) you specify, and organize them by size. Then, for each file of a given size, the first 4kb are compared. This quickly excludes obvious non-matching files. If the size and first 4kb of the files are equivalent, the remainder of the files are compared.
